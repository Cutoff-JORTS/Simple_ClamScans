Hi there, JORT here!

Thanks for pulling a copy of my simple scan! This repo has everything you need to run clamscan (by clamAV) as "user-friendly" as possible.

The shell script DOES REQUIRE clamav to run, and the at-will scan script will run a sanity check to verify install before running. The automated script will **not**, so be sure to install clamav before using it.
